# Write a Bash script that sets up your web servers for the deployment of web_static. It must:

# Install Nginx if it not already installed
# Create the folder /data/ if it doesn’t already exist
# Create the folder /data/web_static/ if it doesn’t already exist
# Create the folder /data/web_static/releases/ if it doesn’t already exist
# Create the folder /data/web_static/shared/ if it doesn’t already exist
# Create the folder /data/web_static/releases/test/ if it doesn’t already exist
# Create a fake HTML file /data/web_static/releases/test/index.html (with simple content, to test your Nginx configuration)
# Create a symbolic link /data/web_static/current linked to the /data/web_static/releases/test/ folder. If the symbolic link already exists, it should be deleted and recreated every time the script is ran.
# Give ownership of the /data/ folder to the ubuntu user AND group (you can assume this user and group exist). This should be recursive; everything inside should be created/owned by this user/group.
# Update the Nginx configuration to serve the content of /data/web_static/current/ to hbnb_static (ex: https://mydomainname.tech/hbnb_static). Don’t forget to restart Nginx after updating the configuration:
# Use alias inside your Nginx configuration

# apt update -y
# apt install nginx -y
mkdir -p /data/web_static/releases/test
mkdir -p /data/web_static/shared
echo -e "<html>\n  <head>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    Holberton School\n  </body>\n</html>" > /data/web_static/releases/test/index.html
ln -sf /data/web_static/releases/test/ /data/web_static/current
chown $USER:$USER -R /data
line="\\\tlocation /hbnb_static {\n\t\talias /data/web_static/current;\n\t}"
sed -i "12i $line" /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
service nginx restart
